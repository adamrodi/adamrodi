# 👋 Hi, I'm Adam Rodi

- 🚀 Computer Science & Data Science @ Southeastern Louisiana University 
- 🎓 4.0 GPA | Former AWS Cloud Support Associate Intern
- 🎯 Focused on software engineering, AI/ML, solving hard problems with code, and always learning.


### 🧠 What I'm Building
- 🦀 Multiplayer Game Server: real-time web game with matchmaking, chat, and WebSocket infrastructure deployed on an Ubuntu VM. Exploring backend concurrency, networking, and state synchronization using Rust and React.
- 🧬 Zebrafish Neural Data Project: applying unsupervised learning and data visualization to biological imaging data. Academic project using clustering and dimensionality reduction, aimed at a conference presentation.
- 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website: developing adamrodi.com to showcase projects, write technical blogs, and host experiments. Hosted on an Ubuntu VM with Apache, HTTPS via Let’s Encrypt, and Cloudflare DNS.


### 🧩 Previous Projects
- 🍽️ Activ-Ate: full-stack fitness & nutrition tracker built with C# (.NET) and React/TypeScript.
Implemented REST APIs, frontend state management, and a responsive UI for tracking meals and workouts.
- ☁️ AWS Troubleshooting Chatbot: Lex + Lambda-powered system for diagnosing OpenSearch yellow/red cluster issues, reducing time-to-resolution for common incidents. Integrated Lambda (Python), CloudWatch, OpenSearch, API Gateway, and CloudFront during my AWS internship.
